This submission includes 2 source files for addtest and sltest written in C code.
I put the content of SortedList.h inside my sltest.c file.
Each implements a multithreaded program. The first one is checking add, while the second one
is checking growing and deleting elements in a linked list.

There is another PDF file that shows the graph. 

Also pleast don't use make to run the code. Please type in the commands on shell.
